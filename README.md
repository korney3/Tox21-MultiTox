# Tox21-preprocessing

(In process)

Using algorithm proposed in "3D Molecular Representations Based on the Wave Transform for Convolutional Neural Networks" (10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01134) for preprocessing Tox21 dataset.

To do
### 21/02/2019
H5py instead deepdish.
Decorator timeout (with multiprocessing or mpi).
Parallelize MPI, deepdish parallel -> imap. Write files for each molecule or connect database (sql lite).

### 05/03/2019
Preprocessing_sbs - notebook with step-by-step demonstration of using functions for preprocessing data.
(need downloaded file `tox21_conformers.db` from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NJsfqvJaMFWPeO-jdE8dNWO_ELJnj1ro to `database` folder)
